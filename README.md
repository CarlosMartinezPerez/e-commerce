# E-commerce Data Analysis

### A small data analysis project over a sales kaggle dataset

Possible business problems that could be addressed:  
+ predict next period sales  
+ predict the customer LTV (lifetime value)  
+ customer segmentation  
+ targetted marketing campaigns  
+ product recommendation  

In order to get the best possible prediction, it is importantant to have the greater correlation between the target variable and the input variables and the least correlation among input variables, in order to avoid multicollinearity.
